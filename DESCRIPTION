Description: A simple tool for SNP mutation type determination. From a VCF file and a 
        reference genome it extracts the reference sequence of length specified by the 
        user and its corresponding variant then there is a function that counts the 
        occurrencies of each SNV and provides a simple plot visualization. 
        This package is designed for analizing human variants.
